# CNN
I used the Keras Sequential API, where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.

The first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.

The CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).

The second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important.

Combining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.

Dropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting.

'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network.

The Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.

In the end i used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier. In the last layer(Dense(10,activation="softmax")) the net outputs distribution of probability of each class.


# Setting Optimizer
Once our layers are added to the model, we need to set up a score function, a loss function and an optimisation algorithm. We define the loss function to measure how poorly our model performs on images with known labels. It is the error rate between the oberved labels and the predicted ones. We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the "categorical_crossentropy". The most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss. I choosed Adam optimizer because it combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent. Specifically:

Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) that maintains a per-parameter learning rate that improves performance on problems with sparse gradients (e.g. natural language and computer vision problems).

Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) that also maintains per-parameter learning rates that are adapted based on the average of recent magnitudes of the gradients for the weight (e.g. how quickly it is changing). This means the algorithm does well on online and non-stationary problems (e.g. noisy).

Adam realizes the benefits of both AdaGrad and RMSProp.

Adam is a popular algorithm in the field of deep learning because it achieves good results fast.

The metric function "accuracy" is used is to evaluate the performance our model. This metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation).


# Conclusion
It seems our model has maximum number of incorrect predictions for Basal cell carcinoma which has code 3, then second most missclassified type is Vascular lesions code 5 then Melanocytic nevi code 0 where as Actinic keratoses code 4 has least misclassified type.

We can also further tune our model to easily achieve the accuracy above 80% and I think still this model is efficient in comparison to detection with human eyes having 77.0344% accuracy
